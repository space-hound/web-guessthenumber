# web-guessthenumber

 - [Live Demo Here!](https://space-hound.github.io/web-guessthenumber/)

A simple game of guessing the number with a nice UI, made for a college class, with some [custom inputs](https://github.com/space-hound/web-blanainputs) that I made in the past. The game and the [custom inputs](https://github.com/space-hound/web-blanainputs) were made without any library or framework.
